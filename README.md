Here, my dear friend, David Kesner, and I will develop and test the code that will run our platform (website).
We aim to build a platform for us to express ourselves in whichever manner we choose: mainly through writing articles, writing music,
producing art (in any shape or form), longer form content (such as podcasts), and many more.
We also aim to spread the art work (in any shape or form) of our friends, family and loved ones.
This is an ongoing project that we have set no time limit on (although we have a planned schedule to keep us on track).
This is our way of demonstrating 'free speech' and 'free will' (whatever that may be).
Our desire is not to spread that of evil, but rather of love, and kindess.
We wish to inspire, first ourselves, secondly our friends, family and lovedones, and lastly the world (to whatever extent that may be).
We hope we can craft a map that allows the viewer to manage the inherent suffering and pain that is being a human, with human consciousness.
Most of all, we hope to encourage a desire for finding fulfillment in life that comes from delaying gratification, and finding a path to loving one's self.
Feel free to contact us if you wish to publish your artwork or craft on our platform, and we will gladly take the time to review your request.
Peace and love.
Regards, James Crowder.
