    <p class="paragraph"> <b>Carl Jung said</b>:
      <br>"The <em>psyche</em> is not of today; it's <em>ancestry</em> goes back many millions of years.
      <em>Individual consciousness</em> is only the <em>flower</em> and the <em>fruit of a season</em>, sprung from the perinnial rhizome beneath the earth;
      and it would find itself in better accord with the truth if it took the existence of the rhizome into its calculations.
      For the root of the matter is the mother of all things." [emphasis added].
    <br><br>
    Here we provide a space for <b>you</b> to <em>tell your story</em> ...
    <br><br>
    A story where there are <em>no limits or boundaries</em> other than the ones we create of our own accord and action ...
    <br><br>
    A tale that is fit for <em>what conscious beings deserve</em> ...
    <br><br>
    <em>A memory</em> that will last <em>a lifetime</em> through the minds and mouths of <em>your family</em> and loved ones ...

    <button type="button" onclick="articlelink()" class="button"><u><b>Here</b></u> </button> is a link (and/or NFT) to a free article we wrote just for you! <!-- Here we
    can write code either in HTML or JavaScript for the function of the "onclick" event of the button. Normally it is easier to write out the code in JavaScript
    and keep better track record of all our functions (just as we keep all the general style and design elements in a CSS file). -->
    <br><br>
    And <button type="button" onclick="explorepagelink()" class="button"><u><b>here</b></u> </button> is a link where you can explore other articles, podcasts, music and
    videos that we (David, James and friends) have put together and published on this website for you to consume and digest at your own timely pleasure
    (and leisure).
